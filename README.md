# gogl
My implementation of a go-gl wrapper package (so a package that wraps the go-gl wrapper, to make it more pleasant to work with).

> Personal usage, use at your own risk! (Best to clone it and work on your own implementation).

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJz71vpNhSU&list=PLDZujg-VgQlZUy1iCqBbe5faZLMkA3g2x&index=42 for the lecture this package is based on.

See also my corresponding [example program](https://github.com/dwrolvink/go_gl) that draws a triangle on a screen, and uses different shaders and movement, using this package.
